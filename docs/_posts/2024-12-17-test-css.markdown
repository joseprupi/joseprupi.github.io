### Intro

Let's begin with what I mean by model validation in this post. Yes, it involves ensuring that models function correctly, a broad topic in itself, but this is specifically focused within the US banking environment.

The rest of this section is just me asking ChatGPT about what a Model Validation in banking is, to both post it here for people that don't know about it and also to make sure understands how this works.

<div class="container">
<div class="text-column">
So, what does Chat GPT say about model validation in this context?
</div>
<div class="prompt-column">
<div class="prompt">
What does model validation mean in the US banking environment? Could you summarize it with few sentences?
<div class="response">
In the U.S. banking environment, model validation refers to the rigorous process of evaluating financial models to ensure they are reliable, accurate, and compliant with regulatory standards. It involves assessing the model's performance, assumptions, limitations, and potential risks. This practice is essential for managing model risk and adhering to regulatory guidelines such as SR 11-7, which requires banks to maintain robust model risk management frameworks to prevent financial and operational issues.

<div class="container">
<div class="text-column">
Alright, we have a base now. We understand that validating models is a regulated process guided by SR 11-7 so let's gather some more detail on what this should be:
</div>
<div class="prompt-column">
<div class="prompt">
What should a model validation contain according to SR 11-7?
<div class="response" markdown="1">
According to SR 11-7, a comprehensive model validation should include the following key components:
* **Evaluation of Conceptual Soundness:** An in-depth assessment of the model's design, theory, and logic, including underlying assumptions and methodology. This ensures that the model is appropriate for its intended purpose.
* **Ongoing Monitoring:** Regular checks to confirm that the model's performance aligns with expectations over time. This includes tracking key performance metrics and reviewing outcomes to identify any significant deviations.
* **Outcomes Analysis:** A quantitative comparison of the model's predictions against actual outcomes. This step helps assess the accuracy and reliability of the model in real-world conditions.
* **Benchmarking and Back-Testing:** Comparing the model's results with alternative models and validating performance through back-testing with historical data.
* **Assessment of Limitations and Uncertainty:** Identifying potential limitations in the model's framework and quantifying any associated uncertainties or risks.
These elements ensure a robust validation process, enabling institutions to identify and mitigate model risks effectively, maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

And what form and structure does a model validation take?

<div class="prompt-column">
<div class="prompt">
How should these results be presented?
<div class="response" markdown="1">
Model validation results, in line with SR 11-7, should be presented in a structured, transparent, and comprehensive report, typically covering the following sections:
* **Executive Summary**: A concise overview of the validation's key findings, model strengths and weaknesses, and an overall assessment of the model’s risk level and validation outcome (e.g., approved, approved with conditions, or not approved).
* **Scope and Objectives**: A clear outline of the validation’s purpose, including the model’s intended use, its assumptions, and limitations. It should specify the validation scope, such as whether it's a full-scope or targeted validation.
* **Methodology and Approach**: A description of the validation process, including the methods, tools, and benchmarks used. This part should clarify how the validation aligns with regulatory requirements and internal policies.
* **Evaluation of Conceptual Soundness**: Findings on the model’s design, methodology, assumptions, and overall soundness. This section often includes a detailed review of data sources, model components, and theoretical foundations.
* **Ongoing Monitoring and Performance Review**: Insights into the model’s stability, accuracy, and predictive power over time, along with performance metrics and any monitoring results that highlight trends or areas of concern.
* **Outcomes Analysis and Back-Testing Results**: Results of outcome analysis, including back-testing findings that compare predicted versus actual results. This section should provide quantitative and qualitative analyses, highlighting any discrepancies and their implications.
* **Issues and Recommendations**: Identification of any issues, weaknesses, or limitations, along with prioritized recommendations for improvements. This can include both short-term remediation actions and longer-term improvements to address identified risks.
* **Conclusion and Sign-Off**: A summary of key points and the final opinion on the model’s viability, along with sign-offs from validation team members and relevant stakeholders.
* **Supporting Documentation**: Additional materials such as data sources, code, validation testing details, and other relevant documents to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
Effective presentation should ensure clarity for stakeholders, including management and regulators, with visual aids like charts and tables where helpful.

Ok, so validating models in banking is assessing they work properly and then write the results in a report. And ChatGPT knows about it. 

While this process seems straightforward, it kind of is, it’s also incredibly useful. And it might be a topic for a different writing, but I don’t believe this practice is common outside of banking, which makes me think that other industries could benefit from adopting a similar approach: a standardized process that ensures models are reliable and used appropriately, with clear and consistent reporting.

Importantly, the goal of this process isn’t just to produce reports, it’s to improve the quality of models. And In my experience, it works. Development teams tend to build better products when they know their work will be audited, requiring them to justify decisions and document their processes in a way that business stakeholders can easily understand.

### A model

Let's now try to reproduce how a validation of a model would look like and how LLMs could assist with it. 

First, we need a model to validate. While almost any model could work for demonstration purposes, I wanted to choose something that resembles a real financial case. I searched on Kaggle and found this challenge:

> [Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability). 
> 
> **Overview:** The goal of this competition is to predict which clients are more likely to default on their loans. The evaluation will favor solutions that are stable over time.

I am not sure how Kaggle works and it is sometimes confusing to me, but I found what appears to be an example notebook that implements a model for the problem, [Home Credit 2024 Starter Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jetakow/home-credit-2024-starter-notebook/notebook). After downloading the data I have executed the code and it works. 

## Regular Content Section

Back to single-column content. Here we can discuss general concepts without needing the two-column layout.

## Another Experiment

For our second test, we gave the LLM a more technical prompt. Notice how it structures the technical information and maintains clarity while explaining complex concepts.

The key observations from this response:
- Precise technical terminology
- Clear step-by-step explanation
- Practical examples included

## Conclusions

This final section uses the full width again to summarize our findings and draw conclusions about LLM behavior.
