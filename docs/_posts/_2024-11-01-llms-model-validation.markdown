# Intro

Lets start with what I mean with model validation in this post. Yes, it is validating models but in the US banking environment specifically.

Validating models can already be a quite broad topic, but let's see what does it mean to validate models in finance according to ChatGPT.

> **Me:** What does model validation mean in the US banking environment? Could you summarize it with few sentences?
>  
> **ChatGPT:** In the U.S. banking environment, model validation refers to the rigorous process of evaluating financial models to ensure they are reliable, accurate, and compliant with regulatory standards. It involves assessing the model's performance, assumptions, limitations, and potential risks. This practice is essential for managing model risk and adhering to regulatory guidelines such as SR 11-7, which requires banks to maintain robust model risk management frameworks to prevent financial and operational issues.

Ok, we have something now. We understand that validating models is something regulated and that there exists an official guideline out there called SR 11-7 that has some more detail about it. Let's gather some more detail on what a validation of a model should be:

> **Me:** What should a model validation contain according to SR 11-7?

> **ChatGPT:** According to SR 11-7, a comprehensive model validation should include the following key components:
>
>* **Evaluation of Conceptual Soundness:**
 An in-depth assessment of the model's design, theory, and logic, including underlying assumptions and methodology. This ensures that the model is appropriate for its intended purpose.
>
>* **Ongoing Monitoring:** Regular checks to confirm that the model's performance aligns with expectations over time. This includes tracking key performance metrics and reviewing outcomes to identify any significant deviations.
>
>* **Outcomes Analysis:** A quantitative comparison of the model's predictions against actual outcomes. This step helps assess the accuracy and reliability of the model in real-world conditions.
>
>* **Benchmarking and Back-Testing:** Comparing the model's results with alternative models and validating performance through back-testing with historical data.
>
>* **Assessment of Limitations and Uncertainty:** Identifying potential limitations in the model's framework and quantifying any associated uncertainties or risks.
>
>These elements ensure a robust validation process, enabling institutions to identify and mitigate model risks effectively, maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

A more clear idea on what is needed.

> **Me:** How should these results be presented?

> **ChatGPT:** The results of a model validation should be presented in a clear, comprehensive validation report. This report should include the following key sections:

Ok, so validating models in banking is assessing they work properly and then write the results in a report. 
As simple and useful this idea seems to be, as it truly is, I don't know this is a common practice out of banking, which makes me think that this might be something others could adopt in a similar fashion. Companies should want to know how appropriate the models they are using are.


This seems simple, because it is, and useful, because it is, but as long as I know nobody else other than banking has a clear process defined to do so. Maybe that is something others should implement in a similar fashion.

# A model

Now I need a model to validate, and although I guess that mostly anything would work I want to chose something that could resemble a real case in finance, so I went to kaggle and searched for it, finding this challenge:

> [Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability). **Overview:**
The goal of this competition is to predict which clients are more likely to default on their loans. The evaluation will favor solutions that are stable over time.
