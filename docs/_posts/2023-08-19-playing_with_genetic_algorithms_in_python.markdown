A long long time ago I was young and going to school, and attending a Computer Science program. It was so long ago that the data structures course was done in C++ and java was shown to us as the new kid on the block that was going to revolutionize everything.

Anyways, we also had two courses called Artificial Intelligence I and Artificial Intelligence II which I would say were given the second year out of the 5 the program lasted, which meant everything was quite new for me and the first year was mostly maths and theory: Calculus I and II, Algebra I and II, Electronics (Physics) I and II... and some things like the C++ data structures. 

In AI I and II we learned all kind of things and as far as I can remember, among them I remember a couple of slides about something called Neural Networks and how they would potentially be the future of AI. Holly molly.

When I started the program I had absolutely no idea about Computer Science and I had never written a single line of code and I remember that one of the things that impacted were the Genetic Algorithms from one of the AI courses. I guess the reason was that GA were one of the first (and few) applied things I saw in CS and also was pretty intuitive. It seemed to me like a simple and brilliant idea.
